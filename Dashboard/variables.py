The aim of this project is to provide feedback on promotion patterns within our client's business. With this information, a tool will be created
to empower employees and assist them in making more impactful career decisions. This study is will provide an exploratory data analysis (EDA) showing current patterns, a model for promotion prediction and a customizable 
tool to suggest actions to employees.

This dashboard is organized with the following structure:

1. Data description - Showing current employee patterns
2. Key variables - How are promotions granted?
3. Employee tool - What can I do as an individual employee?
